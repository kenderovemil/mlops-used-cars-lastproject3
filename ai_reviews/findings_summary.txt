FINDINGS SUMMARY: Azure Login Failure Root Cause
================================================================================

ROOT CAUSE:
The auth-type input parameter is defined as "required: false" in all four
reusable workflow files. When azure/login@v1 receives an empty or undefined
auth-type value, it falls back to auto-detection logic that incorrectly
identifies the setup as user-assigned managed identity instead of federated
identity (OIDC). This triggers Azure CLI to attempt a deprecated managed
identity login command that fails.

SPECIFIC FILES AND LINES TO CHANGE:
1. .github/workflows/custom-create-compute.yml (lines 28-30)
2. .github/workflows/custom-register-dataset.yml (lines 22-24)
3. .github/workflows/custom-register-environment.yml (lines 24-26)
4. .github/workflows/custom-run-pipeline.yml (lines 18-20)

EXACT CHANGE REQUIRED:
Replace:
  auth-type:
    required: false
    type: string

With:
  auth-type:
    required: true
    type: string
    default: IDENTITY

TESTING CONFIRMATION:
After applying the fix:
1. Create pull request to trigger workflow
2. Verify Azure Login step logs show "Using federated identity token"
3. Confirm no "user-assigned managed identity" messages appear
4. Verify all four jobs (create-compute, register-dataset, register-environment,
   run-pipeline) complete successfully
5. Debug output should show auth-type value as "IDENTITY" (not empty)

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 90%
The error messages clearly indicate managed identity mode activation when
federated identity should be used. Making auth-type explicitly required with
a default value will prevent auto-detection fallback.
