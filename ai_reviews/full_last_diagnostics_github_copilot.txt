# Pipeline Diagnostics Report

## 1. Error Summary
### Key Error Message (Azure ML, GitHub Actions)
* Error: (UserError) Existing properties cannot be modified.
* Code: UserError
* Message: Existing properties cannot be modified.
* Details: The AzureML resource/workspace contains a component called 'managementfrontend'. When the pipeline tries to update this component's properties or tags, AzureML refuses due to immutability. 
* InnerError: 'Immutable' / 'ExistingTagsAndPropertiesImmutable'.

#### What does it mean?
- Once registered, tags, properties, and some metadata for AzureML components (such as 'managementfrontend') CANNOT be changed.
- Attempts to update these immutable fields cause job failure.
- Affected job: Pipeline submission referencing or attempting to update this component.
- Other jobs (that do not interact with the immutable resource) can run successfully.

## 2. Diagnostics & Investigation Steps
- Workflow files and pipeline YAML were checked for correctness.
- Referenced components in YAML are registered as: prep_data_component, train_model_component, tune_model_component, register_model_component, managementfrontend (problematic one).
- Dataset, paths, environment, and Azure CLI execution appear correct; issue is NOT with GitHub Actions or artifact upload.
- Error confirmed in both remote Azure ML runs and GitHub-triggered pipeline runs—so issue is in Azure ML configuration/state.

## 3. Why Does Job Succeed Sometimes, Fail Others?
- When pipeline jobs do NOT attempt to update immutable Azure ML properties or tags (or do not reference the problematic resource), most jobs succeed.
- Any job that attempts to update 'managementfrontend' (or another immutable component or property) will fail.
- This can seem intermittent if pipeline or component versions/properties/tags are changed between runs.

## 4. Detailed Recommendations
- **Never attempt to modify (change tags/properties/metadata)** of an existing Azure ML component with the same name/version.
- **Register a new component:** If updates are needed, use a new unique name (e.g., managementfrontend_v2) and/or increment the version.
- **Update pipeline YAML** to point to the new component name/version.
- **If possible, delete the old Azure ML component** (if not needed for other workloads).
- **Coordinate with collaborators/team:** Someone may have registered the original 'managementfrontend' with different tags/properties. Conflicting changes will cause errors.
- **For the quickest fix:**
    - Register a new version/name instead of modifying existing.
    - Audit your workspace for lingering resources (remove if necessary, with caution).
- **For future work:**
    - Ensure all pipeline/job specifications match the exact component metadata registered in AzureML.
    - Standardize component and job registration practices among your collaborators.
